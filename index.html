        <p style="text-align: justify; width: 80%;">Bluegrass Sportsmens's Club (or Bluegrass Sportsmens's League) has been around since 1945 and is where The University of Kentucky Shotgun team holds practice. It was originally significantly closer to Lexington until they were offered an absurd amount of money for the land that they used to be on. They then took that money and bought the 1400 acres they are currenlty on. (This my or may not be true an old man told it to me when I was shooting there once.) Below is a land cover map that displays the different land types that cover Bluegrass.</p>

            <p>On the left side, there is a Cesium slideshow visualizing a lidar representation of the club that guides you through Bluegrass's Shotgun facilities. Upon entering the gate, you may be misled as the Shotgun ranges are not located nearby. After a few minutes, you'll arrive at a building situated atop a small hill, which serves as the clubhouse and the location of the trap fields. If you continue on the road without going up the hill, you'll come across another small hill with a small clubhouse, which is where the two skeet fields are located. Lastly, if you proceed straight instead of going up the second hill, you'll arrive at the begining of the Sporting Clays course.</p>

            <p>On the right, there is a short video of some of the landscapes that were not shown in the slide show. The animation was created in ArcGIS Pro with lidar data sourced from <a href="https://kyfromabove.ky.gov/">kyfromabove.</a> Bluegrass is vast and even frequet vists could still not allow you to see all that it has to offer. The video tries to show off some of the less frequented places on the propterty that are just as beautiful and deserve more eyes. Hopefully the poor rendings entice you to go check it out someday.</p>

            <p>The goal of this portfolio was just to show off a place that has meant a lot to me while I was at The University of Kentucky. Going out and shooting on a weekly basis was one of my favorite things and joing the club was one the best decisions while at UK</p>
